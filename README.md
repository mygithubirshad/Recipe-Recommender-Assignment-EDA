• Through in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we
have gained valuable insights into the factors shaping
average ratings.


• Specifically, 'Review Time Since Submission,' 'Preparation
Time,' and the 'Number of Steps' have been identified as
pivotal elements profoundly affecting recipe ratings.


• Conversely, our analysis indicates that the ‘Nutrition’
columns and the 'Number of Ingredients' lack significant
relevance in determining the average rating.


• These insights will be instrumental in model development
and will aid strategic decision-making for the business.
